    "#  Digital to Analog Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC) is the process by which digital signals, which have discrete values (typically in binary form), are converted into analog signals, which have continuous values. This conversion is essential in many systems because while it's efficient to process or store signals in digital form, many real-world systems and processes still function in the analog domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sound that we hear is analog. However, the music stored on your digital device (like an MP3 player or a smartphone) is in digital form. To listen to the music through speakers or headphones, the device must convert the digital music files into an analog signal, which is then fed into the speakers and heard as sound. This conversion is performed by a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example of a DAC is the binary-weighted resistor network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A binary digital signal is fed as input.\n",
    "2. Each bit in the digital signal is assigned a specific voltage level based on its weight ($2^0$, $2^1$, $2^2$, etc.).\n",
    "3. Each bit controls a switch that connects a specific resistor to an output circuit.\n",
    "4. The voltages associated with the activated resistors (where the bit is a 1) are summed together to produce an analog output voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the binary-weighted method is one of the simplest ways to visualize a DAC, and in practice, many modern DACs use more complex methods and architectures like the R-2R ladder network, delta-sigma modulation, etc., to improve accuracy, resolution, and other performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) does the opposite: it converts continuous analog signals to discrete digital values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 4-bit DAC with input bits $( b_3, b_2, b_1, b_0)$, where $( b_3 )$ \n",
    "is the most significant bit (MSB) and $( b_0 )$ is the least significant bit (LSB), the analog output voltage $( V_{out} )$ can be formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[ V_{out} = b_3 \\times V_{ref} \\times \\frac{8}{16} + b_2 \\times V_{ref} \\times \\frac{4}{16} + b_1 \\times V_{ref} \\times \\frac{2}{16} + b_0 \\times V_{ref} \\times \\frac{1}{16} ]\n",
    "$$\n",
